# BNN + GA

## Applying Genetic Algorithm to Binarized Neural Network training
As a result, we don't need to keep the Real-Valued weights at all,
compared to all other methods.

*[PROTOTYPE]* written in Python
*[binvec class]* written in C++
- supports binary vectors with effective storage & binary operations
